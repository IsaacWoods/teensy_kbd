# teensy_kbd
This is a Rust firmware for mechanical keyboards using the Teensy 3.2 (might also work with the
Teensy 3.1, but not tested). It is currently a work in progress and not suitable for use.

## Dependencies
* [`cargo-xbuild`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild)
* A `thumbv7em-none-eabi` toolchain
* [`teensy_loader_cli`](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader_cli.html)
* [UDev rules for flashing the Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/49-teensy.rules)

## Using the firmware
TODO
